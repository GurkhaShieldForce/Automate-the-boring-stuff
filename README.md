Welcome to my Github Repo - Automate the Boring Stuff.

I'm a total noob when it comes to programming, but I'm learning? 

I started my journey in python few months back and will continue to play around with it and utilize it for some awesome projects.

Here's what I'm doing....

1) Inputvalidation.py - using pyinputplus module; we build an string input validator using "allowRegex" and "blockRegex" methods.
2) anotherfilecreator.py - creates a new excel sheet using openpyexcel module; this one creates a list of VC Firms in the Washington DC Metro Area.
3) excelchart.py - create a new excel sheet and a series of bar chart based on the object on the data defined.
4) mapit.py - Launches a map in the browser using an address from the clipboard or commandline.
5) randomQuizGenerator.py - Generated 35 quiz files with the associated answer key file. Quiz data is defined under the "capitals" dictionary.
6) sandwichmaker.py - create a sandwich based on the various menu item; uses pyinputplus module to control the user input.
7) scraper.py - Scrape "booking.com" via puppeteer module and get data back in .json format. Uses creds and auth strings from Brighdata scraping browser.
8) scraper2.py - Scraping "amazon.com" top sellers with the playwright module. Uses creds and auth strings from Brighdata scraping browser.
9) slotmachine.py - Feeling Lucky! Spin the wheel and bet from range of "MIN_BET" to "MAX_BET" try it out.



Most of these projects are inspired from "Automate the Boring Stuff" from Al Sweigart but I'm trying to pivot into projects that are more into the python x security domain.
